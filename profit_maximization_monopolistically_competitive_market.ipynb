        "Market structures refer to the different organizational structures of markets that exist in the economy. There are four major types of market structures: perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic competition. Each market structure has its unique characteristics, including the number of competitors, product features, pricing, and profit margins.\n",

        "    Perfect Competition\n",
        "    Perfect competition refers to a market structure where there are many buyers and sellers dealing with homogeneous products. The market is characterized by the following features:\n",

        "    Large numbers of buyers and sellers\n",
        "    Identical products\n",

        "    Perfect information\n",
        "    Price takers\n",
        "\n",
        "In perfect competition, the demand curve is perfectly elastic, meaning that sellers cannot influence the market price. The marginal revenue curve is equal to the demand curve since each additional unit of output is sold at the same price. For a particular demand curve p = c-mq, the marginal revenue would be equal to c-2mq.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Monopoly\n",
        "    Monopoly is a market structure where there is only one seller with no close substitutes for the product. The market is characterized by the following features:\n",

        "In a monopoly, the seller has complete control over the market, and the demand curve is downward sloping. The marginal revenue curve is below the demand curve since the seller has to lower the price to sell more units. For a particular demand curve p = c-mq, the marginal revenue would be equal to c-2mq.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Oligopoly\n",
        "    Oligopoly is a market structure where a few sellers dominate the market. The market is characterized by the following features:\n",

        "    A few dominant sellers\n",
        "    Homogeneous or differentiated products\n",

        "    Price setters\n",
        "\n",
        "In an oligopoly, each seller is aware of the actions of the others, and there is interdependence in decision making. The demand curve is downward sloping, and the marginal revenue curve is also below the demand curve. For a particular demand curve p = c-mq, the marginal revenue would be equal to c-2mq.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Monopolistic Competition\n",
        "    Monopolistic competition is a market structure where there are many sellers, but each seller offers a slightly differentiated product. The market is characterized by the following features:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Many sellers\n",
        "    Differentiated products\n",

        "    Price setters\n",
        "\n",
        "In monopolistic competition, each seller has a downward sloping demand curve, but the product is not perfect substitutes. The sellers have some control over the price and are price setters. The marginal revenue curve is also below the demand curve. For a particular demand curve p = c-mq, the marginal revenue would be equal to c-2mq.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the four types of market structures have unique features that distinguish them. Perfect competition has many buyers and sellers, identical products, and is characterized by price takers. Monopoly has a single seller, no close substitutes, and is characterized by price setters. Oligopoly has a few dominant sellers, homogeneous or differentiated products, and is characterized by price setters. Monopolistic competition has many sellers, differentiated products, and is characterized by price setters. The marginal revenue curve for each market structure is below the demand curve."
