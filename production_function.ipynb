    "### Production Function\n",
    "\n",
    "A production function represents the relationship between the inputs used in production and the output that is produced. In this case, we will consider a production function with two inputs: capital (K) and labor (L).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common functional form for a production function is the Cobb-Douglas function, which takes the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q = A K^{\\alpha} L^{1-\\alpha}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where Q represents the output, A is a constant representing total factor productivity, α is the output elasticity of capital, and (1-α) is the output elasticity of labor.\n",
    "Production Function Table\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent this production function as a table by choosing specific values for A and α and plugging in different values of K and L to calculate the resulting output. For example, if we choose A = 1 and α = 0.5, the table might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| K  | L  | Q    |\n",
    "|---:|---:|-----:|\n",
    "|  1 |  1 | 1.00 |\n",
    "|  2 |  1 | 1.41 |\n",
    "|  1 |  2 | 1.41 |\n",
    "|  2 |  2 | 2.00 |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Function Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "To graph the production function, we can plot the output (Q) on the y-axis and the combined inputs of capital and labor on the x-axis. We will hold A and α constant and choose a range of values for K and L. Here is an example graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "Production Function Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "### Isoquant\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can represent the Cobb-Douglas production function as an equation in the form of an isoquant, which shows all the different combinations of K and L that produce a given level of output. In this case, we can rearrange the equation to solve for K in terms of L and Q, which gives us:\n",
    "\n",
    "$K = \\left( \\frac{Q}{A L^{1-\\alpha}} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation represents the slope of the isoquant at any given point, and we can use it to create a graph of the isoquant. Here is an example of an isoquant graph:\n",
